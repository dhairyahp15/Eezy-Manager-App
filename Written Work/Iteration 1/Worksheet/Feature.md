# Feature Story

A feature that was not in our intial Iteration 0 was the Login Page. Although we discussed it we had not thought to actually implement it or create issues to make sure we would complete it. After another feature (a To-do list) was realized to not be possible for the current iteration we were working on, we had to move to creating the login/signup screen. Implementing this feature was interesting as it would have to work with a dummy database. Through trial and error, we decided on a LinkedList of Users to store our data. The feature itself is very important as it will be the first item interacted with when loading into our application. We learned a lot from this iteration and implementing this feature, plans fall through and it is up to us as the team to reevaluate and iterate on what we have already done.
